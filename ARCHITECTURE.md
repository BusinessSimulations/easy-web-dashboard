# Architecture

This project is pretty straight-forward, it is designed to be as minimal and simple as possible.

The tool is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) application, which uses Electron's WebContentsView feature to
show different sites within it, while providing a very simple UI (rendered as normal in Electron using HTML, CSS, and
JS) for navigating these sites.
